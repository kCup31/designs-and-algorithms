# Bridge Pattern

* Decouple abstraction and implementation
* Encapsulation, compsition and inheritance
* Client is unaware of abstraction of backend
* Details wont be right in the beginning
* If u are not sure what the exact stuff u implementing, bridge is a good one
* Example: Driver, JDBC driver
* Design is more complicated.
* composition over inheritance.
* Uses both interfaces and abstract classes.
